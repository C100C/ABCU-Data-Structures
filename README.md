# CS-300-Data-Structures

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I solved in this course was determining the best data structure to use for the Computer Science department at ABCU(a fake university). The advising department wanted the best data structure to store course information. The first project is a pseudocode document containing a way to implement a vector, a hashtable, or a binary search tree. In the first project, I also ran a runtime analysis and created a suggestion of which data structure to use. The second project is the C++ code for my suggestion.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached this problem by understanding the pros and cons of each data structure. By making a pros and cons list while considering ABCUs' needs, I recommend a vector data structure. In project one, there is a detailed list of the pros and cons.
Data structures are important to understand because data needs to be stored somehow. With the increasing amount of data, understanding how to optimize storage and use that data has never been more important. 


## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Using school resources and external resources such as StackOverflow, YouTube, etc, was very helpful. There are lots of videos and websites walking through simple data structures.
When learning about binary search trees, I found it helpful to use paper to keep track of the pointers. And I used paper to help me understand how collisions were handled in a hash table.


## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
My work on this project has helped me better understand data structures and how each affects the runtime and space needs of a program. I did not know what big O notation was before this course. I will take away the understanding that there are optimal ways to store different kinds of data. And taking into consideration the space you have and the speed you need to use that data.


## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project has evolved the way I write programs in a few ways. With this project, the data was structured so, fitting it into a data structure was fairly easy. I now understand that you need to think ahead and pick the right data structure for the job. If you pick a data structure that is easy at the moment, it may cause problems later down the line, making maintenance harder. Certain data structures are also more adaptable than others. Understanding how often data needs to be added and removed is an important consideration. I have always been a believer in making code as reliable as possible. It makes working on it later and having someone else read it much easier.
